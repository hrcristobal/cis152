    <h1>Milk Tea with Boba: A Review</h1>
    <h3> Taste: 4.5/5 <br> Texture: 5/5 <br> Price: 3.5/5 </h3>
    <p>In this review, I will be giving my thoughts on milk tea with boba, or specifically the black milk tea from Happy Lemon. 
        I typically do not like tea, but the sweetness of the milk and added sugar mixes together very nicely so that the tea is a subtle, 
        but pleasant, after taste. The texture is my favorite part of the drink and why I enjoy it so much. The chewy and soft texture of 
        the tapioca pearls is what sets this drink apart from most. The only downside is the cost. The large drink can be around $8 with tax 
        which can quickly add up if you buy it frequently.
