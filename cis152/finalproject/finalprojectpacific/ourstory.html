        <h2>Our Story and Mission</h2>
        <p>Pacific Trails Resort was founded in 1984 by Helena and Mark Wilson. The couple first met in the city of Chicago and realized they shared a passion for the outdoors as well as a dream of escaping their urban lifestyles. On a whim, they decided to pack all their things into a camper van and travel the United States. After visiting many different states, the couple had arrived at the California coast and instantly fell in love with the breathtaking scenery. From the grand, mountainous terrain covered in lush forests to the stunning Pacific ocean views, the couple found it difficult to leave. And so they didn't. The Wilsons invite all nature-lovers to put a pause on their stressful city lives and experience the wonders of this idyllic landscape.

    <p><br><i>"Nature allows us ground ourselves and remember the simple joys of life. At Pacific Trails Resort, we believe that taking a break from the noise of everyday life is essential for reconnecting with ourselves and the world around us. Take a moment to slow down, breathe, and embrace the beauty that nature has to offer. It is our greatest hope that Pacific Trails Resort becomes your place of rejuvenation." - Helena and Mark Wilson </i>
